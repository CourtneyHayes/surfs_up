Module 9 Challenge

### Overview
Using Python, panda functions and SQLAlchemy to find temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. Use this data to examine if a surf and ice cream shop business will be sustainable year-round.

### Results
  1.The standard deviation for both June and December is between 3-4, making it relatively small and meaning the temperature during those months does not change    drastically.
  2.The June minimumn temperature is 8 degrees higher than December's while the max is only 2 degrees. We can infer from this that while nights are cooler in December the days are not much cooler.
  3. mean temperatures for both December and June are both in the low 70's

### Summary
The temperature in Oahu is relatively even throughout the year. By looking at precipitation and wind speeds in the area we could get a more complete idea of the weather to make an informed decision.
